#DARK WEB#

The dark web is a part of the internet that isn't indexed by search engines.
You've no doubt heard talk of the “dark web” as a hotbed of criminal activity and it is.
If we imagine the total internet = 100. Then 96% of its elements are hidden i.e it is inaccessible for civilians.
The rest of 4% is accessible for everyone. 
Most of the elements like Facebook, google, youtube, and bla bla are belonging to this 4%.
This 4 % is called the surface web. And 96% hidden portion is known as dark web.
Also, there are more hidden items, known as the deep web.

#DEEP WEB#

The deep web,invisible web,or hidden web are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard web search-engines.
The opposite term to the deep web is the "surface web", which is accessible to anyone/everyone using the Internet.

#Deep web vs. dark web: What’s the difference?#

The terms “deep web” and “dark web” are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are not the same. 
Deep web refers to anything on the internet that is not indexed by and, therefore, accessible via a search engine like Google. 
Deep web content includes anything behind a paywall or requires sign-in credentials. 
It also includes any content that its owners have blocked web crawlers from indexing.

Medical records, fee-based content, membership websites, and confidential corporate web pages are just a few examples of what makes up the deep web.
Estimates place the size of the deep web at between 96% and 99% of the internet.
Only a tiny portion of the internet is accessible through a standard web browser—generally known as the “clear web”.


The dark web is a subset of the deep web that is intentionally hidden, requiring a specific browser—Tor—to access, as explained below.
No one really knows the size of the dark web, but most estimates put it at around 5% of the total internet. 
Again, not all the dark web is used for illicit purposes despite its ominous-sounding name.
